AndroidViewUtils
================

Setup
-----
I have intentionally excluded all the IDE related files or files that require specific paths.
Therefore in order to get this code into your IDE you will need to use the "Create Project from Existing Code" or similar option.
You will also need to copy the project.properties.sample file to project.properties and then customize (if needed).

All of this is so that any other contributions are not poluted with developer or IDE related noise.
I am sorry for any inconvenience.


Notes
------
- All android resources must be in lowercase, so please be mindful of this when adding your fonts to your /res/raw directory
